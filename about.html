                <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>I'm Max, a funny-looking guy from West Texas. Iâ€™m currently a junior at UT Austin, pursuing a BFA in Design with a certificate in Computer Science. My interests are all over the place when it comes to design, but my main focus is on the web. I enjoy making art in the physical space and the digital space and often find myself trying to combine the two. Right now I am working as a website manager for an org at the UT Environmental Center, but I am always open to a new opportunity. 
                    <a onClick= 'window.location = "contact.html"'>Contact me</a> for Inquiries.
                    <br><br>I coded this website, which is still a work in progress, so please feel free to report any bugs to me :)
